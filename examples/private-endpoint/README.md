This deploys private endpoint for automation accounts

## Notes

Additional modules will be used to configure private endpoints and private dns zones.

Currently, thereâ€™s no dedicated subresource or private endpoint support solely for cloud-based runbooks. Therefore it's tied to the subresource DSCAndHybridWorker.
